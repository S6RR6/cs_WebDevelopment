        <div class="left"><p>I'm having trouble making a decision on which type of coffee I want from Starbucks- between their two lightest and darkest blends. While their dark roast has a full body and chocolate-velvet taste, it's a bit heavy on the tongue and leaves an aroma of aftertaste. On the other hand, their light roast is lighter and sweeter than it's counterpart, although because of this lightness it comes off watery and tastes more like tea than coffee.</p></div>
